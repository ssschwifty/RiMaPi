    You think its annoying that you have to hover every single champion in your champion screen to find out, with what champion you havent earned a mistery chest yet?
    No problem just have a look at the hazzle free champions list with champions whose chest you havent earned yet.

			Chests granted: {{grantedChests}}

		<div>
			Chests still waiting to be granted: {{notGranted}}
