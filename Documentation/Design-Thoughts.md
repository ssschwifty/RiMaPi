# Project Unnamed - Concept
## Abstract
Our aim was to create a single page web application that enables the user to easily access information which is extracted from the data provided by the RIOT Games Champion-Mastery-API. We thought about some statistics and information that may not be as obvious and easily accessable that one might think.

## The Website
The website is a singled paged application with TODO different tabs. Each tab represents a functionality of the website and one statistic type created from the riot api data.

The website has the following tabs(Whose design is quite similar):

### Improve yourself!
Some people are looking for new champions to play and have no idea how to exactly find them. Some just go for the favorites of the month, which may be good idea, but to be honest: As long as you're not diamond and higher it doesnt really matter which champion you play, as long as youre having fun and youre good with him(yes, you can even carry with teemo!). So we thought it would be a good idea to help those people by making a list available sorted by the average champion score earned. So theyre champions you already excelled with, but maybe forgot about or only played a few times.

Sometimes your good with a champion and you dont even know it! We utilized the information about the average mastery-grade to show you with what champions you rock the house and with whose you dont. Maybe it will give you a new idea what to play and maybe even whom to choose as new main.

### Collect Mystery-Chests the easy way
We talked to some friends and some are farming mystery chests. They think its very annoying, that you have to hover every single champion in you champion windows to find out, with whom you havent earned a mistery chest yet. Luckily the riot api gives you that information, so that it eases the search of available champions by filtering the list.

Because the mastery api doesnt return all champions we merged the list with all champions that have not been played yet.

You think its annoying that you have to hover every single champion in your champion screen to find out, with what champion you havent earned a mistery chest yet? No problem just have a look at the hazzle free champions list with champions whose chest you havent earned yet.

### Brag about your skills
We thought it would be nice to implement an possibility to let the community interact with each other. So the easiest way to do this is to appeal to peoples honor and ambition and let them compare themselves with they're friends and even brag about it, if they want to. Maybe this will cause them to go head to head in a mastery-score competition. Every1 plays more lol, every1 has more fun. Mission accomplished.

Compare yourself to a friend and send him an E-Mail if youre the better Champion-Mastery collector!

### Increase your Mastery-Level
Some people may want to raise theyre mastery score, especially  after they have seen that some friends have higher scores. We created a List of all champions sorted by the experience needed to get the to next level. So you can play with specific champions to gain the maximum amount of levels in the shortest time possible.

You compared yourself to a friend and he has more mastery levels? Dont loose any time and play the champions that are close to the next mastery level. So that you overtake your friend and you can send him an email about it.


### Technical documentation
We wanted to make the technical documentation and our design thoughts easily accessible without forcing the users to use the github page. So we decided to embed the complete documentation on our website.
