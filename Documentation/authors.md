# About the authors

## Fred
Hi,
my name is Fred and I'm studying applied computer science at the "FHDW Hannover" (http://www.fhdw-hannover.de/). I study in a corporate program with the WKG-Software GmbH  (http://www.wethinkmobile.com/) which means that I alternating study three months and work three months. My company is specialized in CRM-Systems for phone book publishers. At work I spend most of the time with Backend-Developement with PL/SQL or CrossPlatform developement with Xamarin Studio (app developement is supposed to be become a new pillar in our company). My hobbies are playing LoL (obviously :D), cooking (and eating of course, too), riding my bycicle or just hanging out and meeting with friends.

I think I have learned a lot of new stuff during the Riot-Api challenge, especially since I have never worked with Angular or Node.js before and am already looking forward to the next one, next year. I hope I will be able to program a game by then, so I can submit another awesome piece of work, but out of a different genre.

Hello, I'm Sarah, 21. I also study applied computer science at the same place as Fred does. I am currently working for the mobile development/webdesign company Projektionisten GmbH (it's in German, but the pictures are nice: https://www.projektionisten.de/ ;)), where I got to learn all the stuff that's useful for creating a website like RiMaPi. Unfortunately I am a total n00b when it comes to LoL... Yeah, that's it. Obama out.
